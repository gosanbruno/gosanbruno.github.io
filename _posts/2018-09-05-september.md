* [Rail Fair at Ardenwood Farms][rail] in Fremont @10am-4pm

Our family attended the Ardenwood Rail Fair 2018 on Monday. The event was heavily attended. The wait for the train was much longer this year -- probably about 40 minutes -- because the park has been reduced to one diesel train pulling 2 cars of passengers. New California state requirements require that trains have air brakes installed. The park's vintage steam train does not have these upgrades and one of the park's train operators said that the park does not plan to spend the money for the upgrade. The new regulation is something to keep in mind because the wait times will also be much longer for other train-based events such as the Halloween ghost train that the park holds. Nevertheless, the event was still great fun for the kids. Train ride dissapointment aside, there remain plenty of other fun activities to do on the farm. So, shift your expectations towards farm fun and de-emphasize the train.
