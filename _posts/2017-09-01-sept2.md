We ended up going to the Millbrae Art & Wine Festival on Saturday during the record-breaking Bay Area heat wave. It was 100 degrees outside! I felt a bit sorry for the vendors because attendance at the festival was low due to the heat. (I would guess half as many people as usual.) On a normal year it would be wall-to-wall people enjoying beer & wine and there would be a line 10-kids deep for the rides. After plodding around in the heat we went to Hillsdale Mall to cool off. Needless to say the mall was slammed with people trying to stay out of the heat. We went back home to our 88 degree house, which actually wasn't as bad as it sounds.

* [Belmont Greek Festival][belmont] @noon-10pm

Big-time beach day for most folks. A nice warm clear day in Half Moon Bay almost never happens so traffic on West 92 towards HMB was extra heavy but not too different from pumpkin patch season. 60-minute drive from San Bruno to Lemos Farm (we went to Lemos for a birthday party). Lemos Farm was real quiet because people aren't in Pumpkin-mode yet. After the party we went to Tanforan mall to cool off and dropped $20 at GAMA Ride arcade. Interesting fact: Target stores across the Bay Area were sold-out of any type of house fan.

* [Belmont Greek Festival][belmont] @noon-8pm

I had planned to take the kids to the Rail Fair Monday but regrettably I got food poisoning from something eaten the day before. C'est la vie. We ended up going running errands and going to Grundy Park in the morning and Crystal Springs Park in the afternoon.
