The weather will be nice and warm this weekend. Here are some quick ideas:

[San Bruno Pool][pool]! Open rec swim from 1pm-4pm on [Saturday and Sunday][hours]. See Pool website for fee information.

[Apple picking][apples]? We went to Davenport's Swanton Cal-poly apple farm with the kids. It's about 90-ish minute drive from San Bruno. This is not a commercial operation: it's completeley self-service and you pay on the honor system. I'm more accustomed to full-on apple-picking experience with cider, donuts and hay rides. It's a nice drive nonetheless and there are other activities you can do along the way like strawberry picking or going to the beach.
