## Saturday Sept 16, 2017

[Los Altos Train Days][train] is an excellent event for young railfans (train enthusiasts). My son has passed his peak interest in trains but he'll still look at them. The Los Altos event boasts a variety of portable layouts and scale sizes.

## Sunday Sept 10, 2017

I didn't see anything interesting to me for Sunday. Check [for yourself][kidfun]. Maybe the [Marine Mammal Center][mammal] in Sausalito is interesting -- they are open 2nd and 4th weekend each month.
