After trip report: Disneyland!
===

In our school district the first weekend of October is a 3-day weekend to observe Columbus Day (a.k.a. Indigineous Peoples' Day). Seeing an opportunity to take a short trip out of town my wife and I decided it would be a good time to take the kids to Disneyland for a few reasons. 

First off, kids under 3 years old can go to the park for free! My daughter was 2 and a half and has recently become obsessed with Minnie Mouse and Elsa & Anna from Frozen. She hasn't seen much of either of the Disney cartoons but she has a few hand-me-down Disney pajamas that she frequently demands to wear at every opportunity. It's cute but also extraordinarily frustrating when she's hellbent on wearing unwashed, filthy Frozen pajama tights.

Secondly, Halloween at Disneyland is really special. The park pulls out all the stops with Halloween-themed decorations all over the park and they redecorate several of the rides. The Haunted Mansion gets a full makeover to look like Tim Burton's _The  Nightmare Before Christmas_. They also sell Halloween-themed churros and other menu items.

Third, we've never been to California Adventure! Usually our trips to Southern California are filled with visits to see relatives from both sides of the family so it's pretty rare that we have 1 day to tool around a theme park let alone have 2 full days.

Fourth, my parents would coincidentally be in town for the long weekend making the weekend a good opportunity to swoop into town and have dinner with my parents a couple of times.

Lastly, I finally had the gumption to use some of my Chase Ultimate Rewards points that we earned through the epic 100,000  signup bonus points promotion that ran from mid-2016 to early-2017 that reward point bloggers are still talking about. My brother lives about 20 minutes from Disneyland but we wanted to burn some points and be able to get into the park without having to deal with parking. I am not scientific about redeeming points for the maximum dollars-per-point value and we've had the card for almost 2 years now and I haven't canceled it despite the $450 + 75 (for spouse) annual fee. In that way we must be ideal customers for Chase. But I think we've gotten a fair value for the card because of the $300 travel credit and a substantial cost of the trip to Disneyland, which I'll get to in a second, was covered by miles redeemed at the 1.5x bonus travel redemption rate. I do need to be sure to redeem travel points more frequently because Chase could take away the 1.5x bonus any time.

Hotel: Hyatt Place at Anaheim Resort/Convention Center

At first I wanted to stay at the Disney Grand California on the park grounds but the weekend was prohibitively expensive at around $700 per night! $2,100 for a 3-day weekend in SoCal? I don't think so. I probably get 6 nights in a pretty good hotel in Hawaii for that.

There are plenty of hotels in the Disneyland area to choose which gave us serious paralysis by analysis. We filtered according to this criteria, which the Hyatt Place mostly satisfied.

Filter criteria 1: Free hot breakfast, not continental breakfast. In the 3 nights we stayed at the Hyatt place we had scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, cold cereals, english muffins and assorted fruit. Overall I would say they offer a good hot breakfast on par with IHOP/Denny's.

Filter criteria 2: In-room fridge. We need a fridge for late night milk. I was hoping for a mini kitchenette with a microwave and some plates but it turns out we wouldn't have needed the microwave anyway because we in the parks for lunch and had dinner with my family each night.

Filter criteria 3: walking distance to the park. The Hyatt place is a 20 minute walk from the front door to the Disneyland entry gates. It's an easy walk. The only frustration is that the wait times for crosswalks are probably around 2-minutes per intersection. The hotel is conveniently across the street from Disney's Toy Story parking lot. It's about a 5-7 minute walk to the shuttle bus area and a 5-7 minute bus ride to the gate. The shuttles are abundant so we didn't wait for more than 5 minutes to go from standing in line to the bus leaving to get to the park.

I was very satisfied with Hyatt Place. It is a solid option for a Disneyland hotel. We also considered going to *Hyatt House* which is one block closer to the park entrance gate but it cost $40 more per night. Given our criteria I don't regret making the distance for cost tradeoff. 

Cost: 40,600 points or approximately $609.00 including taxes & fees
Extra fees: $20 per day fee for parking

Car: Standard sedan from Alamo LGB airport

I like renting cars at LGB because the car rental lot is directly across the street from the terminal. The downside is that the Alamo/Enterprise booth always has a line! There are 6 car rental agencies on the premises but everybody has to get in line at Alamo. Clearly they must be the cheapest. We got a nice surprise this time around because I reserved a Camry from Alamo but they gave me a free upgrade to a Premium class Nissan Maxima with 300hp because that's all they had. The Maxima felt like driving a Ferrari compared to my daily-driving 150hp Toyota Prius V. :-)

Cost: 14,438 points / $216.57 including taxes & fees. 
Extra fees: No extra fees to drop off car at LAX.
