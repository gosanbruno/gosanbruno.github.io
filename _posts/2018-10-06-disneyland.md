After trip report: Disneyland!
===

In our school district the first weekend of October is a 3-day weekend to observe Columbus Day (a.k.a. Indigineous Peoples' Day). Seeing an opportunity to take a short trip out of town my wife and I decided it would be a good time to take the kids to Disneyland for a few reasons. 

First off, kids under 3 years old can go to the park for free! My daughter was 2 and a half and has recently become obsessed with Minnie Mouse and Elsa & Anna from Frozen. She hasn't seen much of either of the Disney cartoons but she has a few hand-me-down Disney pajamas that she frequently demands to wear at every opportunity. It's cute but also extraordinarily frustrating when she's hellbent on wearing unwashed, filthy Frozen pajama tights.

Secondly, Halloween at Disneyland is really special. The park pulls out all the stops with Halloween-themed decorations all over the park and they redecorate several of the rides. The Haunted Mansion gets a full makeover to look like Tim Burton's _The  Nightmare Before Christmas_. They also sell Halloween-themed churros and other menu items.

Third, we've never been to California Adventure! Usually our trips to Southern California are filled with visits to see relatives from both sides of the family so it's pretty rare that we have 1 day to tool around a theme park let alone have 2 full days.

Fourth, my parents would coincidentally be in town for the long weekend making the weekend a good opportunity to swoop into town and have dinner with my parents a couple of times.

Lastly, I finally had the gumption to use some of my Chase Ultimate Rewards points that we earned through the epic 100,000  signup bonus points promotion that ran from mid-2016 to early-2017 that reward point bloggers are still talking about. I am not scientific about redeeming points for the maximum dollars-per-point value and we've had the card for almost 2 years now and I haven't canceled it despite the $450 + 75 (for spouse) annual fee. In that way we must be ideal customers for Chase. But I think we've gotten a fair value for the card because of the $300 travel credit and a substantial cost of the trip to Disneyland, which I'll get to in a second, was covered by miles redeemed at the 1.5x bonus travel redemption rate. I do need to be sure to redeem travel points more frequently because Chase could take away the 1.5x bonus any time.
