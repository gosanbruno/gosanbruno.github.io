I highly suggest buying an annual pass for the county parks. It's only $60 per year ($5/month!). Without the pass you would normally have to pay $5 per visit to some of the finest parks on the Peninsula.

The pass will get you into a few of my favorite San Mateo County Parks:

* Crystal Springs Park, San Bruno -- the one with the giant slide.
* Coyote Point Park, San Mateo -- where CuriOdyssey is
* San Bruno Mountain Park, Daly City -- fantastic city and Bay views. Near Steak 'n' Shake.
* ... and many more!
